// Builder widget for widgets that need to be animated from 0 (unselected) to
// 1.0 (selected).
//
// This widget creates and manages an [AnimationController] that it passes down
// to the child through the [builder] function.
//
// When [isSelected] is `true`, the animation controller will animate from
// 0 to 1 (for [duration] time).
//
// When [isSelected] is `false`, the animation controller will animate from
// 1 to 0 (for [duration] time).
//
// If [isSelected] is updated while the widget is animating, the animation will
// be reversed until it is either 0 or 1 again. If [alwaysDoFullAnimation] is
// true, the animation will reset to 0 or 1 before beginning the animation, so
// that the full animation is done.
//
// Usage:
// ```dart
// _SelectableAnimatedBuilder(
//   isSelected: _isDrawerOpen,
//   builder: (context, animation) {
//     return AnimatedIcon(
//       icon: AnimatedIcons.menu_arrow,
//       progress: animation,
//       semanticLabel: 'Show menu',
//     );
//   }
// )
// ```
